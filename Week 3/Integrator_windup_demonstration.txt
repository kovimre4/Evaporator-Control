Integral Windup

X1 increase to 25 from 5

P2 below demand

F200 required from control too negative therefore saturates and P2 does not return 
to demand

F200 control demand continues to integrate and become more negative

X1 decrease back to 5 - operating point (returns P2 to 50.5)

F200 at saturated level to return P2 to 50.5 for long time due to integrator wind up

Therefore P2 overshoots 50.5 by a lot until F200 controller comes back from wind up

- Clamp PI L2 at +-208
